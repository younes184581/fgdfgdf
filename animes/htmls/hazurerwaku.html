 <p class="desc">Mimori Touka has always been something of a background character in his high school. So when he and his classmates are summoned to a fantasy land and gifted with incredible skills, it seems like the perfect opportunity to make a name for himself.

    The only problem? Mimori’s skills are abysmal at best, and he’s banished to a deadly dungeon.
    
    But as he begins to test these new abilities, he discovers just how powerful he’s become. Can Mimori fight his way back to exact revenge?!
